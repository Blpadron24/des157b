                The Davis Centennial Seal is fun to look at because it contains a ridiculous amount of intricate detail, the more you observe the more you see. Every section tells its own story but as a whole it tells the story of the wonderful city that I have come to love and call home. What stands out to me the most about the seal is its depiction of connection, throughout the seal you can see people interacting, communicating, and existing with one another.
