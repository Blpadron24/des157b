            <p>
                For this project I want to explore an interactive design that allows users to explore the city of Davis through some of the elements found on the centennial seal. The idea is to create a map of the city and design a treasure hunt in which users locate different areas within the map and learn about the different elements of the seal as they explore Davis. Parts of the seal would be revealed as the user explores key locations and the completion of the map results in the completion of the seal. 
                  </p>

                  <p>Iâ€™m excited to develop this project with Santhoshi and merge our ideas in a way that allows both of us to express our creativity. An idea for this is to develop two versions of our project. One that is designed for kids in the fourth grade and another that is designed for eleventh graders. This will allow us to work together to create the backbone of the project and have some creative freedom when designing the two versions. </p>

                  <p>We are just at the beginning stage of this project and Santhoshi and I have a lot more to discuss. We especially need to identify how the users are going to interact with the project and how they will be guided through discovering the different areas of the map. </p>
